# BorderPrice

 BorderPrice is a simple API for price comparison of a product between countries. It uses the MercadoLibre API for retrieving prices of the same product in most of the countries where that company makes businesses. The idea is to add functionality in an iterative way so it can, not only retrieve information about prices at that moment, but also about relative price changes in historical perspective. 
 (*Fact number 1) I like economics and economics history.
 (*Fact number 2) Latin America is one of the regions with higher prices for electronic devices(quote needed... or maybe I made that up)
 (*Fact number 3) Why does this project have such an awful name? Why is this inside the 'facts' section, if this is a question?
